## My Personal CDN

**What?**

Public repository for hosting public links to images. 

**Why?**

I tried uploading an image to Reddit. I couldn’t figure out what I was doing wrong with Imgur. So… here we are.

> **UPDATE:** That repo name lasted long. I should have just named it, reddit, but hindsight and all that. Welp, Bob Dylan is now being added to this. Let’s be honest though, adding Bob Dylan to anything is going to make it better.

> **UPDATE 2:** I went ahead and renamed this repo now while it’s easier. I also better organized the directories.
