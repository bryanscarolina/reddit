## Returnal Cheatsheet

1. Never. Stop. Moving. Ever. 
2. You're invincible when you're dashing and when you're grappling. Take advantage of your these iframes when you need to.
3. Don't pick up parasites _at first_.
4. Don't pick up malignant items unless A. you cleanse them first with Ether or B. you've got the Nullification Sphere consumable that removes malfunctions.
5. \#3 and \#4 are two of the quickest ways to ruin an entire run if you're not careful.
6. Don't avenge scouts in the beginning. Although this is a great way to farm ether, depending on which minibosses may get summoned, you may be in for a long ride (or short death).
7. Resin makes your HP bar longer but doesn't fill it up. Silphium fills it up. Cleansing Silphium costs 2 ether and usually worth it if you're at low health.
8. When you get to a fabricator to buy items, always, and I mean **always**, buy Silphium Vials - there are large and small ones.
9. If you have an Astronaut in your fabricator, buy it. It gives you an extra life.
10. When you first start out, worry about unlocking your weapon traits. This gradually makes the game so much easier. They'll start showing up on the weapons you pick up in consecutive runs. 
11. All weapons are viable. Don't underestimate melee.
12. You can unlock certain shortcuts once you progress far enough in the level that allows you to cut out significant portions of the game.
13. You're supposed to die. It actually screws up the storyline if you don't die.
14. Light blue rectangle doors are progression, dark blue triangle doors are optional. Light blue rectangle doors with a circle above them indicate shortcuts to another biome.
15. Adding one more not in the screenshot, but even once you unlock other biomes/worlds, I'd recommend staying in the 1st Biome long enough to reach the fabricators in order to purchase a Large Silphium Vial and Astronaut (if available). They're easiest to reach in Biome 1 and Biome 5.
